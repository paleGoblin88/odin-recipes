    <h2>Beef Miso Ramen Recipe</h2>
    <p>Beef miso ramen is a dish that consists of Chinese-style wheat noodles served in a soup made with beef broth and miso paste. The soup is typically flavored with soy sauce, sake, and mirin, and may include ingredients such as sliced beef, green onions, and mushrooms. It is a variation of traditional Japanese ramen, which is usually made with pork-based broth.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) beef sirloin steak</li>
        <li>Â½ cup gluten-free soy sauce (tamari)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon coconut oil</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons miso paste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 (3 ounce) packages ramen noodles</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine steak and soy sauce in a plastic container with a lid. Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Remove steak from the marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.
        </li>
        <li>Heat coconut oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add steak and cook until firm and reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 3 to 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C) for medium-rare. Remove from skillet and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While the steak is resting, combine broth, miso paste, garlic, and sesame oil in a saucepan over medium heat; bring to a boil. Once broth is at a slow boil, add ramen noodles. Cook until noodles are soft, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Transfer broth and noodles to 2 bowls. Slice steak and place on top.</li>
    </ol>
